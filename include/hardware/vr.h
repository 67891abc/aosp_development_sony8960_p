/**
 * Implement this HAL to receive callbacks when a virtual reality (VR)
 * application is being used.  VR applications characteristically have a number
 * of special display and performance requirements, including:
 * - Low sensor latency - Total end-to-end latency from the IMU, accelerometer,
 *   and gyro to an application-visible callback must be extremely low (<5ms
 *   typically).  This is required for HIFI sensor support.
 * - Low display latency - Total end-to-end latency from the GPU draw calls to
 *   the actual display update must be as low as possible.  This is typically
 *   achieved by using SurfaceFlinger in a single-buffered mode, and assuring
 *   that draw calls are synchronized with the display scanout correctly.  Any
 *   GPU settings required to allow consistent performance of this operation
 *   are required, including the EGL extensions: EGL_IMG_context_priority, and
 *   EGL_XXX_set_render_buffer_mode.
 * - Low-persistence display - Display persistence settings must be set as low as
 *   possible while still maintaining a reasonable brightness.  For a typical
 *   display running at 60Hz, pixels should be illuminated for <4ms to be
 *   considered low-persistence (<2ms is desirable).  This avoids ghosting
 *   during movements in a VR setting.
 * - Consistent performance of the GPU and CPU - When given a mixed GPU/CPU
 *   workload for a VR application with bursts of work at regular intervals
 *   several times a frame.  CPU scheduling should ensure that the application
 *   render thread is run consistently within 1ms of when required for the
 *   draw window, and an appropriate clockrate is maintained to ensure the
 *   workload finishes within the time alloted to the draw window.  Likewise,
 *   GPU scheduling should ensure that work from the application render thread
 *   is given priority over other GPU work, and that a high enough clockrate can
 *   be maintained to ensure that this completes within the draw window.  CTS
 *   tests with example VR workloads will be available to assess performance
 *   tuning.
 *
 * Vendors implementing this HAL are expected to use set_vr_mode as a hint to
 * enable VR-specific performance tuning, and to turn on any device features
 * optimal for VR display modes (or do nothing if none are available). Devices
 * that advertise FEATURE_VR_MODE_HIGH_PERFORMANCE are must pass the additional
 * CTS performance tests required for this feature and follow the additional
 * guidelines for hardware implementation for "VR Ready" devices.
 *
 * No methods in this HAL will be called concurrently from the Android framework.
